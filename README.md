This project is about the four colour theorem. The four colour theorem states that every map / image with contigous planes could be colored in with four colours. Th

The assignment was:
1. Here are three different maps, make an algorithm to colour them in in the least amount of steps
2. do the same thing for three social networks ( person A has person C and D as friend etc.)

To run these scripts, go to the running_enviroment.py file and choose which options to use, then run the script to get an output result.
